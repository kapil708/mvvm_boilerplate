# Flutter MVVM Architecture Rules

This project follows MVVM architecture with Bloc/Cubit as the ViewModel layer. Always maintain these patterns and structure.

## Rule Files Reference

All detailed rules are organized in modular files within the `cursorrules/` directory. Reference the appropriate rule file based on your task:

### Core Rules
- **Project Structure**: [mdc:cursorrules/structurerules.mdc] - Directory organization, file placement, naming conventions
- **Theme & Styling**: [mdc:cursorrules/themerules.mdc] - Theme configuration, styling patterns, design system
- **Feature Development**: [mdc:cursorrules/featurerules.mdc] - Feature module patterns, view/viewmodel guidelines
- **Data Models**: [mdc:cursorrules/modelrules.mdc] - Model creation, JSON serialization, data layer patterns
- **State Management**: [mdc:cursorrules/staterules.mdc] - Bloc/Cubit patterns, state management best practices (to be added)
- **Navigation**: [mdc:cursorrules/navigationrules.mdc] - Routing, navigation patterns, route configuration (to be added)
- **API & Network**: [mdc:cursorrules/apirules.mdc] - API client setup, network layer, error handling
- **Dependency Injection**: [mdc:cursorrules/dirules.mdc] - GetIt setup, service registration patterns (to be added)

## Architecture Overview

- **Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **State Management**: Bloc/Cubit as ViewModel
- **Dependency Injection**: GetIt
- **Navigation**: GoRouter
- **Network**: Dio + Retrofit
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences
- **Localization**: Flutter Intl

## Quick Reference

### Project Structure

├── data/                    # Data layer (models, repositories, sources)
├── di/                      # Dependency injection

    ├── common/              # Reusable UI components
    └── features/            # Feature-based modules
```

### Naming Conventions
For detailed naming rules, see: [mdc:cursorrules/structurerules.mdc]

- **Files**: `snake_case.dart`
- **Directories**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

### Feature Structure
For feature development guidelines, see: [mdc:cursorrules/featurerules.mdc]

Each feature must have:
- `view/` - UI components
- `viewmodel/` - State management (Cubit/Bloc)

## Usage Guidelines

### When Working on Project Structure
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/structurerules.mdc]
- Use for: File placement, directory organization, naming conventions

### When Working on Themes/Styling
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/themerules.mdc]
- Use for: Theme configuration, styling patterns, design system, text styles, colors, spacing

### When Creating Features
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/featurerules.mdc]
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/structurerules.mdc] (for structure)
- Use for: Feature module creation, view/viewmodel patterns, state management, navigation

### When Working with Data Models
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/modelrules.mdc]
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/structurerules.mdc] (for placement)
- Use for: Model creation, JSON serialization, data layer patterns, json_serializable usage

### When Working with State Management
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/staterules.mdc] (when available)
- Use for: Bloc/Cubit patterns, state management best practices

### When Working on Navigation
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/navigationrules.mdc] (when available)
- Use for: Routing, navigation patterns, route configuration

### When Working on API/Network
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/apirules.mdc]
- Use for: API client setup, network layer, error handling, Retrofit, Dio, repository patterns

### When Setting Up Dependencies
- Refer to: [mdc:cursorrules/dirules.mdc] (when available)
- Use for: GetIt setup, service registration patterns

## Important Guidelines

1. **Always follow established patterns**: Reference the appropriate rule file(s) for your task
2. **Maintain separation of concerns**: Data, presentation, and core layers must remain independent
3. **Use dependency injection**: All dependencies should be injected via GetIt, never instantiated directly
4. **Follow naming conventions**: Strictly adhere to naming conventions defined in [mdc:cursorrules/structurerules.mdc]
5. **Keep features independent**: Features should not directly depend on other features
6. **Use absolute imports**: Prefer absolute imports (`package:mvvm_boilerplate/...`) for cross-layer imports
7. **Place files correctly**: Always place files in appropriate directories as defined in [mdc:cursorrules/structurerules.mdc]

## Adding New Rule Files

When adding a new rule file to `cursorrules/`:
1. Create the `.mdc` file in `cursorrules/` directory
2. Add a reference in the "Rule Files Reference" section above
3. Add usage guidelines in the "Usage Guidelines" section if needed
4. Update this file to link to the new rule file
